# Should We worry about our future: the Need for More EV Charging Station in Ottawa
#### Only 31 government founded EV charging station is on used in Ottawa in 2022
---
#### Introduction
As the notion of an environment-friendly economy and sustainable economic development is promoted to the general public, people’s intention to purchase more electric vehicles is more potent, a phenomenon worldwide. [The demand for electric vehicles in Ontario has rapidly increased](https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/toronto/electric-vehicle-charging-infrastructure-ontario-1.6752224) in recent years. According to Statistics Canada, in 2022, the number of hybrid and electric vehicles [increased by 5.2% compared to 2021’s statistics.](https://www150.statcan.gc.ca/n1/daily-quotidien/221011/dq221011c-eng.htm) Not only is the demand growing, but also the ownership of electric vehicles is boosting in Canada. The announcement from the Liberal government in 2021 claims that [all the new cars will be zero-emission by 2035.](https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/calgary/canada-electric-cars-2035-1.6085540) This announcement surely pushed the progress of most vehicles in Canada to convert to electric. It pushed people to purchase electric cars, and the intent of promoting an environmentally friendly society was indicated. From another perspective, people’s willingness to convert their commuter tools from gas vehicles to electric vehicles is worth exploring. Now, we are sure that the future of Canadian vehicles is approaching electric in multiple patterns. <br>
The motivation for choosing electric cars as the means of transportation is not just policy-driven but also the price of charging the vehicles. Electricity as the energy source of electric vehicles is indispensable. Due to the limitation of the capacity and the nature of the electric car’s battery, the number of miles that the vehicle can be driven is influenced by the outdoor temperature. Therefore, charging facilities have become significantly important for electric vehicles. <br>

#### Methodology
Thus, in order to understand the current usage situation of electric vehicle charging stations in Ottawa, I withdrew the dataset from Open Ottawa that records the usage dataset of electric vehicle charging stations in Ottawa and imported it into Google Sheets for data cleaning. The dataset labels all the government-owned charging stations located in Ottawa. It indicates the coordination of every charging station and records the time of each charger connection (including the start times and end times). Moreover, the charging time is documented in the dataset. I will analyze it according to Open Ottawa’s dataset to explore the potential picture of the future development of electric vehicles in Ottawa.

In the dataset, there are several cases where multiple charging stations share one coordination in the same address. I assume that those charging stations are in the same parking lot but different parking spots near each other. To be effective and productive, I conduct the number of charges according to the station and site. However, I will use the number of charges based on the site as the primary material for analysis. A pivot table is created with the Site as the Row; `COUNTA of Site` and `SUM of Charging time` as the values. Then, I use `COUNTA of Site/SUM of Charging time` to generate the average charging time for each usage and I use `=Value(D2*24*60)` to convert the average charging time into minutes. After the raw dataset is cleaned, I import it into datawrapper to generate a split bars chart to demonstrate the statistics.

#### Analysis
From the chart, we can see that the frequency of the charging stations’ usage is led by the charging station located in City Hall. Throughout the entire 2022, the infrastructure is used 908 times, but the average time of each charging is around 109 minutes. The charging station located in Chapel Hill Park N Ride leads the average charging time with approximately 405 minutes. This number is outstanding from the dataset because the majority of the average charging time is around 100-200. The number illustrates people who travel to the Chapel Hill Park N Ride use the charging station for a longer time. I assume the reasons for this situation might be the lack of home charging in the surrounding area or the purpose people visit this location. The rest of the charging infrastructures are located in the residential zone or on the street. However, the number of charging frequencies in 1551 Lycée Place is the lowest. This situation is abnormal because the charging station located at 1551 Lycée Place is near an apartment building. I assume that the ownership of EVs around the charging station is low so it leads to low demand for EV charging stations. <br>
Moreover, the coordination of the charging station indicate the distribution of charging stations. The map is conducted based on the data from the columns POINT_X and POINT_Y as the longitude and latitude and each location is labeled based on the Station. Inputting the cleaned dataset that contains POINT_X, POINT_Y and Site into the Google My Map to generate the map demonstrates the locations of each charging station.

The data shown previously indicates that we need more charging stations in Ottawa. 
Councillor Shawn Menard also states in a phone interview

“The charging station is not enough because people worry about ranging anxiety and where they are going to charge.” 
“We need to spread this around the city and some connection points between destinations.”
The charging station cannot only be distributed in the urban core of Ottawa. The charging facilities need to be spread widely with the consideration of population distributions. 
Councillor Wilson Lo states that more charging stations should be installed between cities and rural areas.
Lo mentions that private companies will notice the market of charging stations when there is a demand. 
He raises another potential issue: whether the government can provide stable electricity for all the charging stations (including home charging, government funds, and private companies funds).

#### Conclusion
The current trend for vehicles in Canadian society is shifting to EVs. People are buying more zero-emission vehicles as their new car not only because of the awareness of being environmentally friendly but also the government announcement and cheaper price for charging it. We can predict the future will be full of electric vehicles and this future will happen soon. However, the charging facilities need more effort to keep up with the ownership and it needs the entire society to make the effort including citizens, the government, and private enterprises.
