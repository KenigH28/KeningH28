# Should We worry about our future: the Need for More EV Charging Station in Ottawa
#### Only 31 government founded EV charging station is on used in Ottawa in 2022

#### Introduction
As the notion of an environment-friendly economy and sustainable economic development is promoted to the general public, people’s intention to purchase more electric vehicles is more potent, a phenomenon worldwide. [The demand for electric vehicles in Ontario has rapidly increased](https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/toronto/electric-vehicle-charging-infrastructure-ontario-1.6752224) in recent years. According to Statistics Canada, in 2022, the number of hybrid and electric vehicles [increased by 5.2% compared to 2021’s statistics.](https://www150.statcan.gc.ca/n1/daily-quotidien/221011/dq221011c-eng.htm) Not only is the demand growing, but also the ownership of electric vehicles is boosting in Canada. The announcement from the Liberal government in 2021 claims that [all the new cars will be zero-emission by 2035.](https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/calgary/canada-electric-cars-2035-1.6085540) This announcement surely pushed the progress of most vehicles in Canada to convert to electric. It pushed people to purchase electric cars, and the intent of promoting an environmentally friendly society was indicated. From another perspective, people’s willingnesses to convert their commuter tools from gas vehicles to electric vehicle are worth exploring. Now, we are sure that the future of Canadian’s vehicle is approaching to electric in multiple pathes. <br>
The motivation for choosing electric cars as the means of transportation is not just policy-driven but also the price of charging the vehicles. Electricity as the energy source of electric vehicles is indispensable. Due to the limitation of the capacity and the nature of the electric car’s battery, the number of miles that the vehicle can be driven is influenced by the outdoor temperature. Therefore, charging facilities have become significantly important for electric vehicles. <br>

#### Methodology
Thus, in order to understand the current usage situation of electric vehicle charging stations in Ottawa, I withdrew the dataset from Open Ottawa that records the usage dataset of electric vehicle charging stations in Ottawa and imported it into Google Sheets for data cleaning. The dataset labels all the government owned charging stations located in Ottawa. It indicates the coordination of every charging station and records the time of each charger connection (including the start times and end times). Moreover, the charging time is documented in the dataset. I will conduct an analysis according to Open Ottawa’s dataset to explore the potential picture of the future development of electric vehicles in Ottawa.

In the dataset, there are several cases where multiple charging stations shared one coordination in the same address. I assume that those charging stations are in the same parking lot but different parking spots near each other. To be effective and productive, I conduct the number of charges according to the station and site. However, I will use the number of charges based on the site as the primary material for analysis. A pivot table is created with the Site as the Row; `COUNTA of Site` and `SUM of Charging time` as the values. Then, I use `COUNTA of Site/SUM of Charging time` to generate the average charging time for each usage and I use `=Value(D2*24*60)` to convert the average charging time into minutes. After the raw dataset is cleaned, I import it into datawrapper to generate a split bars chart to demonstrate the statistics.

Moreover, the coordinations of the charging station indicate the distribution of charging stations. The map is conducted based on the data from the columns POINT_X and POINT_Y as the longitude and latitude and each location is labeled based on the Station. Inputting the cleaned dataset that contains POINT_X, POINT_Y and Site into the Google My Map to generate the map demonstrates the locations of each charging station.
